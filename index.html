            <h2>Components of Computer Hardware <i id="f" class="fas fa-desktop icon"></i></h2>
            <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
            <p>The CPU, often called the "brain" of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions from programs. It consists of millions of transistors acting as tiny switches to process data.</p>

                <img id="myImage" src="Intel-CPU1.jpg" alt="Intel CPU">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> Performs mathematical and logical operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> Directs all operations within the CPU.</li>
                <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Small storage locations for immediate data processing needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Memory</h3>
            <p>Memory is crucial for storing and retrieving data. It is divided into primary and secondary storage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Volatile memory used for temporary data storage while the computer is on.</li>
                <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> Non-volatile memory used to store firmware.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Storage:</strong> Includes HDDs (Hard Disk Drives), SSDs (Solid State Drives), and cloud storage for long-term data storage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Binary Number System <i class="fas fa-user-secret icon"></i></h2>
            <p id="binary-text">Binary is a base-2 number system using only two digits, 0 and 1. Computers use binary to perform all operations because it corresponds directly to the on/off states of transistors in the CPU.</p>
            <button onclick="toggleBinaryInfo()">Toggle Detailed Info</button>
            <div id="binary-info" style="display: none;">
                <p><strong>Why Use Binary?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simplicity in Digital Electronics:</strong> Binary makes it easier to design and implement digital circuits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Binary states (on/off) are less prone to error compared to multiple states in higher-base systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All data and instructions in a computer are eventually translated into binary for processing. High-level programming languages are converted into binary code by compilers, enabling the CPU to execute the instructions.</p>
